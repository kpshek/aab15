            <speakers>How do you define 'value'? What does it take for a business to shift 'Value' into high gear and create experiences leaving your customer saying "Wow"? Why does the software industry struggle to even meet expectations?  If you're struggling to create valuable experiences for your customer then this session is for you.</speakers>
            <speakers>Every team I work with talks about delivering valuable features, and yet many of their customers are dissatisfied. When I question how they define value I might get text book answers about ROI, sales, efficiencies or other quantifiable measures. Although these are important measures, I don't believe 'value' can be defined by anything you can quantify. If that's true then how do we get from "Valuable" to "Wow" without going broke?</speakers>
            <speakers>We will start by examining two similar customer experiences. Both experiences are valuable, one met expectations but the other left the customer going 'Wow!'. Regardless of what business your in, with some awareness it's possible to start creating more 'Wow!' moments for your customers.</speakers>

            <speakers>Let's face it, when organizations want to "go Agile", they really want help solving a problem they can't quite put their finger on. Some of the time they may buy a tool and call themselves Agile. Other times, they'll implement a few practices but not much more. There are no shortage of tools, methods and techniques for installing Agile and there are an equal number of failure stories. At the end of day, Agile is simply a trigger for an organizational change.</speakers>
            <speakers>In this session you'll learn 3 techniques that will help you navigate through complex change by working on a real problem with your peers. After all, a consultant or coach is only going to take you so far!</speakers>

                Description:&#xD;
                Design Thinking refers to the methods and processes to investigate complex problems in highly uncertain systems, acquiring information, analysing knowledge, and positing solutions. This workshop is about the usage of this process to better understand organisation's culture and minimise resistance to change in the creation of an Agile culture. The strategy is to combine empathy for the context, creativity in the generation of insights and solutions, and rationality to analyse and fit solutions to the context. This solutions are aimed to create reasons for people in the organisation to embrace Agile.&#xD;
                This iterative process of observation, ideation and implementation can be integrated within your retrospectives and also applied outside IT to create a continuous improvement engine for organisational culture in organisations.</speakers>

            <speakers>In this session I'm showing a model that organizations can use to foster the adoption of agile. This model is "locally" based on lean startup, understandig Agile initiatives from different countries as startups, and "globally" it uses the validated learning cycles of every organization to create a validated learning knowledge base with the performed experiments of agile practices in diferent environments. This "validated learning knowledge base" is co-created by the members of the internal international Agile community and shared through A3 report sheets. &#xD;
                Lean Start up principles as foundations for a change strategy, A3 thinking and problem solving as a support for lean continuous improvement, Agile Journey mapping as a strategy designing tool and Validated Learning Knowledge Base as a support for effective sharing, compose a complete and easy to use framework that can help communities, multisite organisations and groups of Agile leaders to boost Agile adoption in their business units.</speakers>
            <speakers>This model has being experimented in the Dutch multinational organisation ING.</speakers>

            <speakers>Are you tired of TDD workshops that make you do boring things like calculate bowling scores and prime factors or demonstrate how to win at the game of life? If so, this is the session for you In this TDD workshop we will be building the domain model for EverCraft -- a new MMORPG from Blizzards of the Coast. We have lots of story cards prepared covering features from combat to magic, classes to spells, and races to items. Plus, we'll be defining some of these cards during the session in case you want that +9 knife of ogre slaying or enjoy casting magic missile at the darkness.</speakers>
            <speakers>This workshop is language agnotisic and for all levels of developers. The focus is on TDD and emergent design but pair programming will be covered as well. The only requirement is that you bring a laptop and that you be able to test-drive you code with your language of choice. When you are done you will emerge a better programmer for the experience but there is small chance you will have a craving for Cheetos and Mountain Dew.</speakers>

            <speakers>Agilistas are often quick to dismiss any practice that looks like a remnant of the 'waterfall days.'  Process management tends to be one of those end-to-end activities that looks, smells and tastes like a waterfall initiative, but don't be fooled!</speakers>
            <speakers />
            <speakers>Process management is a vital part of preparing the ground for a successful agile design effort.  There are certainly times when process is not so important to software design, but if you're building business software, it is foundational.  In this environment, good process management doesn't guarantee good design, but lack of it makes the probability of good design less likely.</speakers>

            <speakers>Is business process improvement part of Lean IT? What about best practices and benchmarking? Is agile software development a Lean IT practice? What about IT operational excellence and the ITIL service management framework? How about performance management dashboards and scorecards? Is applying Lean techniques to project management considered a Lean IT practice? And is cloud computing relevant in a Lean IT world? The answer to all these questions is yes. But Lean IT is much more than just a set of tools and practices; it is a deep behavioral and cultural transformation that encourages everyone in the organization to think differently about the role of quality information in the creation and delivery of value to the customer.</speakers>
            <speakers>Lean IT enables the IT organization to reach beyond alignment toward fundamental integration, cultivating an inseparable, collaborative partnership with the business. Whether you are new to Lean, or a seasoned veteran, in this book you will find new insights into the power of Lean and the critical impact of an integrated IT function. In this discussion Patrick Phillips will explore all aspects of Lean IT within two primary dimensions:</speakers>
            <speakers>Outward-facing Lean IT: Engaging information, information systems, and the IT organization in partnership with the business to continuously improve and innovate business processes and management systems</speakers>
            <speakers>Inward-facing Lean IT: Helping the IT organization achieve operational excellence, applying the principles and tools of continuous improvement to IT operations, services, software development, and projects These two dimensions are not separate but complementary.</speakers>
            <speakers>The adoption of the term Lean software development is more than a name change. While agile is a set of development and life cycle management tools and methods focused on the just-in-time development of quality software, Lean software development addresses a larger context: the environment within which the software operates, the value streams of the enterprise. For example, in a business application, properly functioning software is viewed as a supporting element of the business process. In an embedded software application (such as the operating system of a smartphone or the control systems of a jet aircraft), the software is part of the overall product design and value proposition to the customer. Lean emphasizes seeing the whole through the eyes of the customer, not its component parts through the eyes of the designer or developer. 'Lean software development views all Agile methods as valid, proven applications of Lean thinking to software,' says Jeff Sutherland, a signer of the Agile Manifesto. 'It goes beyond Agile, providing a broader perspective that enables Agile methods to thrive.'</speakers>
            <speakers>In the words of Mary and Tom Poppendieck, 'A Lean organization optimizes the whole value stream, from the time it receives an order to address a customer need until software is deployed and the need is addressed. If an organization focuses on optimizing something less than the entire value stream, we can just about guarantee that the overall value stream will suffer.' We have witnessed many skilled agile practitioners fall into the common Lean trap: focusing on tools and techniques rather than solving problems and eliminating waste. Lean software development expands agile's focus from optimizing the software development process toward improving entire value streams. Thus, Lean software development must integrate and synchronize with all business processes, management systems, and kaizen activity, supporting the Lean transformation of the overall enterprise.  This session will take you into a discussion with a practitioner who is one of the industry's leading figures in understanding and utilizing lean.</speakers>

When transitioning from waterfall to agile some pain is to be expected; the approach and underlying principles are different.  However, teams and organizations often look for quick fixes to these pains.  This often results in only addressing the symptoms of some larger dysfunction that may be deeply seeded in the culture.  This talk will explore some of the most commonly experienced pains at both the team and organizational levels.  Typical (incorrect) solutions will be presented as will some of the most probable true issues and how to address each.</speakers>

In this interactive presentation, we will step back from our emphasis on frameworks, technologies, and process and consider what would allow us to move beyond these constraints. We will look at the reasons why we have needed guardrails to deploy software more predictably and frequently, and recognize that many of these guardrails tend to accomodate rather than eliminate disfunction. I will share a vision of what delivery could look like in the near-future to inspire us to think futher ahead as we evolve our industry.</speakers>

            <speakers>Most teams would rather work to deliver value to customers than spend time estimating stories.  In order to spend less time estimating and more time delivering value to the customer, many teams have adopted 'Affinity Estimation'.  Using 'Affinity Estimation' many teams have significantly reduced the time required to estimate and I have personally been involved in sessions that used to take 60 minutes and are now taking 15 minutes.  By using 'Affinity Estimation' to compare new stories to real stories that were recently completed, teams are able to quickly and confidently provide an estimate without lengthy discussions and worries of the unknown.</speakers>
            <speakers>The session will begin with a brief presentation highlighting everyday problems that coaches deal with when estimating stories.  Then, using volunteers from the audience, we will work through a series of exercises/games demonstrating the value of "Affinity Estimation" while teaching the audience and the volunteers how to coach these exercises for their own teams.</speakers>
            <speakers>This session will provide you with exercises that you can use for existing teams, as well as, new teams.</speakers>

            <speakers>Why doesn't being 'Agile' always mean creating innovative, world-changing, valuable software?  This session will focus on the tools and techniques of Requirements Craftsmanship and Lean-Start-up including understanding and creating Business Value, Value Stories, Story Mapping, and Getting out of the Building, that are the building blocks of value for Agile teams and, importantly, the customer and stakeholders for whom Agile teams create.    Participants will also explore the differences between measuring the output from Agile teams and measuring the outcomes that indicate value acheived.   This session will give participants real experience Requirements Craftmanship and introduce them to the challenges of making sure that Agile teams produce valuable software early and continuously, which is the highest priority of the Agile Manifesto and the goal of Requirements Craftsmanship.</speakers>

            <speakers>Sometimes people in organizations feel as though Agile has been pushed on them. They end up going through the motions, without any real sense of ownership of what they are doing. Instead of actually implementing meaningful changes, organizations end up doing "Agile in name only" by slapping Agile labels on existing processes. Then Agile is blamed for "not working". This isn't an Agile problem. It's an alignment and ownership problem. In this session, through theory and multiple real-world case studies, you'll learn how to co-create change by involving the people affected by the change in the design of the change.</speakers>

            <speakers>Creating a backlog of user stories is pretty straight forward but it doesn't help you when it comes to decisions like what to build first, how to prioritize and groom the backlog, how to slice your stories, how to scope and plan the project, and how to visualize progress. The traditional backlog is simply too flat and often too long to help you see the bigger picture and make good decisions. User Story Mapping helps simplify all of these common project issues. By adding a third dimension to your backlog, your team will make better decisions about priorities, scope, and planning while improving your ability to visualize progress.</speakers>
            <speakers>In this practical tutorial we'll focus strictly on creating story maps. We'll start the tutorial by creating an introductory map that will help you understand the basics. The remainder of the tutorial we'll create and then refine a story map map based on a project overview and some given scenarios. After this tutorial you'll be ready to create maps for your own projects.</speakers>

            <speakers>As much as the agile manifesto talks about 'responding to change', sooner or later, someone has to write a check to pay for things — and that person would probably prefer to avoid unbounded uncertainty. This workshop works through issues of cost, and risk, including how to communicate team performance. Use a combination of simulation, discussion, and presentation, Matt Heusser, Joseph Ours, and Damian Synadinos will cover various models for planning, from stories, to velocity, project comparison, #NoEstimates, Guru Method, and Predictive models. You'll leave with a firstfull of ideas to try, along with specific information of the strengths and weakness of each approach, including both technical and social angles.</speakers>

            <speakers>In his book Thinking Fast and Slow, Nobel winner Daniel Kahneman introduces two mental systems, one that is fast and the other slow. Together they shape our impressions of the world around us and help us make choices. System 1 is largely unconscious and makes snap judgments based upon our memory of similar events and our emotions. System 2 is painfully slow, and is the process by which we consciously check the facts and think carefully and rationally. However, System 2 is easily distracted and System 1 is wrong quite often. System 1 is easily swayed by our emotions. Examples he cites include the fact that pro golfers are more accurate when putting for par than they are for birdie (regardless of distance), and people buy more cans of soup when there's a sign on the display that says 'Limit 12 per customer.' In this session we will, through interactive games, learn how our minds can affect our abilities to investigate, observe, and recall events. We'll discuss some strategies to minimize our minds erroneous impacts to those abilities.</speakers>

            <speakers>Is Agile purely a software development tool?  Of course not!  The principles of Agile can applied just about anywhere.  So why hasn't all of your IT organization adopted Agile practices?</speakers>
            <speakers>The truth is, once your software project is done and you're on to the next one, IT Operations takes over.  Systems administration, networking, desktop support, and data management must all work in concert to support your application.  Are you in alignment with the entire value chain?</speakers>
            <speakers>This talk will cover a number of management philosophies, including Agile, Lean, ITSM, and Gamification, and discuss how they can be applied outside of software development to bring greater alignment and effeciency to the enterprise IT department.  We'll show you real life examples of where Agile practices have been successfully adopted outside of software development, the challenges we faced in our own transformation, and how we overcame them.</speakers>

            <speakers>It is as if something conspires to make Scrum ineffective.  &#xD;
                &#xD;
                Let's get real. Scrum is designed to expose problems. It does not, by itself, solve the problems. In theory, Scrum provides a framework for the team to work through the solution themselves. In practice, politics, rhetoris, and lack of training often get in the way.&#xD;
                &#xD;
                This talk is about understanding common Scrum problems and breaking through ruts.&#xD;

            <speakers>In a software development team, there are two primary jobs: development and support. However, depending on the size of the team, sometimes it is not feasible to separate these roles between developers. Problems arise when a team receives critical support requests during a sprint. Changing the scope of the sprint is not allowed; allocating certain team members to fix the issue may jeopardize the momentum of development. How can a team compromise between fulfilling customer requests immediately without impacting sprint development? In this talk, Sam will present a case study on how his team restructured its workflow to handle incoming requests while preserving sprint momentum.</speakers>

            <speakers>Agile is so much more than rituals and buzzwords, but often the real value is lost as organizations focus more on adhering to processes than the reasons behind them. Teams all too easily fall into the trap of following a prescribed method and deviate little from that original template. A continuous improvement approach implies a team is regularly questioning, tweaking, and iterating on its own version of Agile. Today's set of practices and processes should not be identical to those from a year ago.</speakers>
            <speakers>Join Blake Nyquist and Wade Wachs for a discussion on Agile thinking and how to break out from a fixed set of processes.

But how do teams share a common understanding of a business model when tackling a problem? And have fun at the same time? At Menlo, before we tackle software development, we visualize our problem spaces through two "share and make sense" techniques that render even the most complex technical problem accessible to anyone involved in a project discussion. Using simple, inexpensive tools--and a lot of teamwork--you will learn the art and craft of graphic object modeling and visual work flows that are guaranteed to promote both smiles and lively discussions.</speakers>

Establishing shared understanding of the problem we are trying to solve and the capabilities we bring to the task can be difficult. At the heart of the challenge is making our thoughts tangible and meaningful to others.</speakers>
            <speakers>Using Lego&amp;reg; SeriousPlay&amp;trade; materials and methods to surface and express what is inside ourselves is a powerful technique for energizing teams. Based on cognitive neuroscience and learning theory these techniques have been proven to be effective in a broad range of contexts and group sizes. Deliberate play is a key component to social interaction and creative problem solving in groups.</speakers>

            <speakers>As a business analyst on an agile team, do you spend your time gathering decisions from Product Owners (or stakeholders) and passing them on to development teams? Are you tired of simply being a 'proxy without power?' What can you do to boost your impact and become invaluable to your team?</speakers>
            <speakers>In this workshop, Diane Zajac-Woodie demonstrates how any team can benefit from the communication and facilitation skills of an experienced BA. Through some experiential exercises, you will learn what impact collaboration has on results and why requirements are just as important as ever. Diane also teaches you how to document requirements so people will actually read them. Using Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD), you will practice writing requirements that describe the exact behaviors that you expect in a format that everyone understands.</speakers>
            <speakers>Be inspired to embrace your role in an agile environment and leave with new techniques that encourage more cohesive teams and ultimately lead to higher quality software.</speakers>

            <speakers>When something goes wrong in your personal or working life how do you respond? Do you blame someone else for creating the situation? Do you just simply say 'Wow I suck!' and accept that things cannot get better? Although responses such as these prove you're human, they also don't improve the outcome. If you find yourself stuck on problems do you want to move past them? The Responsibility ProcessTM is the result of decades of research and defines how humans respond to loss or failure.</speakers>
            <speakers>The Responsibility Process has  allowed me to create lasting improvements in my career and life with outcomes I can be proud of. As an accredited practitioner in The Leadership Gift ProgramTM I would like to share this simple process with you. You will be able to take what you learn and start applying it tomorrow.</speakers>

            <speakers>Scrum suggests that business analysts, testers and developers shed their old job titles and don the badge of 'team member.' And current trends like mob programming further encourage team members to abandon their individual goals in the interest of team achievements. It seems there really is no 'I' on some teams...but should there be?</speakers>
            <speakers>In this session, Diane evaluates the pros and cons of eliminating job titles and examines the concept of becoming a generalizing specialist. What does that really mean? What are the impacts to the team? Can you maintain your individual skills while your contributions to the team are getting blurred?</speakers>

            <speakers>When delivery issues are made visible, there is often an immediate and natural change in behavior. In this session I will demonstrate a simple technique we have used with several teams at my current client to track Cycle Time and Process Cycle Efficiency (PCE) using Lego. In some cases, team members started to behave differently right away, as soon as they saw where the time was going. Two interesting effects occurred naturally, without any training. First, teams that saw a lot of red Lego on their boards adjusted their work in process (WIP). They didn't know the term "WIP" but they could see the effect and acted appropriately on the information. Second, the moment a team mate placed a red brick on the board, other team members asked what the impediment was and how they could help remove it.</speakers>

            <speakers>What does it mean to build antifragile relationships and teams? Teams and organizations, at least successful ones, are based on relationships that "work." Often we say we want 'strong' or 'good' relationships, but is 'strong' good enough? We will look at ways you can identify if the foundation of your team relationship is fragile or antifragile. Then we will work with a number of approaches and tools to help you create or expand on the foundation of an antifragile for your team.</speakers>
            <speakers>Help your team (or organization) move towards a space where your relationships and therefore teams can thrive. We will consider how to build an alliance with a team and how to setup, in advance, to deal with potential conflicts. We will also explore a number of common issues contributing to toxic team situations. Antifragile is not an endpoint.  Like agile, it is a journey and mindset. The ideas we will explore are not just about "them", but are about "us" first. We have to start with us. What can WE bring to the table and what can WE do or be. Expect to work individually and with others in this interactive workshop.</speakers>
